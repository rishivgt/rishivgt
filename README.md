## Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
I'm Rishiv Tadiparthi. My intended major is Information Technology/Cybersecurity. 
I'm currently working on a career plan project where I would describe what my career entails and an informational interview project where I would interview a person in my major to learn more about opportunities in my major. 
I'm currently learning how to use GitHub and Linux.
